# ConwaysGameOfLife
A c++ version of Conway's Game Of Life.

# About
This is Conway's Game Of Life using cellular automata.

SDL2 is used for creating and drawing to a window, as well as capturing input.
I build it up from an empty c++ project. 

#Controls
- Spacebar: start/stop simulating
- Enter: show/hide the grid
- Backspace: clear the grid

#Features I might add later
- On screen/in console settings to choose resolution, the size of the cells, etc..
- Loading/saving data to a file so you can load previously made scenes or save scene you made
